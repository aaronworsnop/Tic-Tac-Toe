# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an AI Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java using the MiniMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The final board states are rated based on their status (win, tie, and loss) and their depth, so the AI will always choose the move that is most advantageous, rather than an advantageous move.

How to Play
To play the game, simply run the Main.java file located in the src directory. The game will prompt you to enter your moves and will display the board after each move.
